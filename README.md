#### **_Description_**

##### A description of a project

The objective of the game is to recall as many words as possible from the list. The participant will initially view the entire board containing all sight words. The participant then selects a card, flips it over so the word is visible, and reads the word. The participant then chooses and turns over a second card, reading the word on the second card. If the words on two overturned cards match, the cards are discarded and the participant receives a new turn.
